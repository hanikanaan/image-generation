# Image Generation Site using OpenAI's DALL-E model

## Tools
This project was done using the MERN stack, as well as deploying using Render.com's pipeline to host the backend, while hosting the frontend on Hostinger.com. To store the images, Cloudinary was used to upload the images and then submit them to the MongoDB Atlast instance so that they can be accessed later through the community page.
